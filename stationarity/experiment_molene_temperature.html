<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Graphs are a central tool in machine learning and information
processing as they allow to conveniently capture the structure of
complex datasets. In this context, it is of high importance to develop
flexible models of signals defined over graphs or networks. In this
paper, we generalize the traditional concept of wide sense stationarity
to signals defined over the vertices of arbitrary weighted undirected
graphs. We show that stationarity is intimately linked to statistical
invariance under a localization operator reminiscent of translation. We
prove that stationary signals are characterized by a well-defined Power
Spectral Density that can be efficiently estimated even for large
graphs. We leverage this new concept to derive Wiener-type estimation
procedures of noisy and partially observed signals and illustrate the
performance of this new model for denoising and regression.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The French national meteorological service has published in open access
a dataset with hourly weather observations collected during the Month
of January 2014 in the region of Brest (France). From these data, we
wish to ascertain that our method still performs better than the two
other models (TV and Tikonov) on real measurements. The graph is built
from the coordinates of the weather stations by connecting all the
neighbours in a given radius with a weight function <span class="math">\(w(i,j) = e^{-d^2\tau}\)</span>
where <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> is adjusted to obtain a average degree around <span class="math">\(3\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>, however, is not a sensitive parameter). For our experiments,
we consider every time step as an independent realization of a WSS
process. As sole pre-processing, we remove the mean of the temperature.
Thanks to the <span class="math">\(744\)</span> time observation, we can estimate the covariance
matrix and check wether the process is stationary on the graph.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>The result of the experiment with temperature is displayed in Figures 1
and 2. The covariance matrix shows a strong correlation between the
different weather stations. Diagonalizing it with the Fourier basis of
the graph assesses that the meteorological instances are more or less
stationary within the distance graph by highlighting its diagonal
characteristic. Moreover this diagonal gives us access to the PSD of
the data. In our experiment, we solve an in-painting/de-noising problem
with a mask operator covering 50 per cent of measurements and various
amount of noise. We then average the result over <span class="math">\(744\)</span> experiments
(corresponding to the <span class="math">\(744\)</span> observations) to obtain the curves
displayed in Figure 2. We observe that Wiener optimization performs
significantly better when the noise level is high and equivalently well
to the two other methods for low noise level.</p>
