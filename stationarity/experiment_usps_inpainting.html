<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Graphs are a central tool in machine learning and information
processing as they allow to conveniently capture the structure of
complex datasets. In this context, it is of high importance to develop
flexible models of signals defined over graphs or networks. In this
paper, we generalize the traditional concept of wide sense stationarity
to signals defined over the vertices of arbitrary weighted undirected
graphs. We show that stationarity is intimately linked to statistical
invariance under a localization operator reminiscent of translation. We
prove that stationary signals are characterized by a well-defined Power
Spectral Density that can be efficiently estimated even for large
graphs. We leverage this new concept to derive Wiener-type estimation
procedures of noisy and partially observed signals and illustrate the
performance of this new model for denoising and regression.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>We perform the same kind of in-painting/de-noising experiment with the
USPS dataset. For our experiments, we consider every digit as an
independent realization of a GWSS process. As sole pre-processing, we
remove the mean (over pixels and digits). It is also possible to remove
the mean of each pixel separately. It might increase the stationarity
level of the data. In this contribution, we choose not to perform this
pre-processing as we consider the raw data stationary. We create the
graph using patches of pixels of size <span class="math">\(5 \times 5\)</span>. The pixels' patches
help because we have only a few digits available. When the size of the
data increases, a nearest neighbor graph performs even better. We
estimate the PSD using only the first <span class="math">\(20\)</span> digits and we use <span class="math">\(500\)</span> of
the remaining ones to test our algorithm. We use a mask covering <span class="math">\(50\)</span>
per cent of the pixel and various amount of noise. We then average the
result over <span class="math">\(500\)</span> experiments (corresponding to the <span class="math">\(500\)</span> digits) to
obtain the curves displayed in Figure 2. For this experiment, we also
compare to traditional TV de-noising and Tikonov de-noising.
Additionally we compute the classical MAP estimator based on the
empirical covariance matrix for the solution. The results presented in
Figure 2 show that graph optimization is outperforming classical
techniques meaning that the grid is not the optimal graph for the USPS
dataset. Wiener once again outperforms the other graph-based models.
Moreover, this experiment shows that our PSD estimation is robust when
the number of signals is small. In other words, using the graph allows
us for a much better covariance estimation than a simple empirical
average. When the number of measurements increases, the MAP estimator
improves in performance and eventually outperforms Wiener because the
data is close to stationary on the graph.</p>
