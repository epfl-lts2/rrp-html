<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Graphs are a central tool in machine learning and information
processing as they allow to conveniently capture the structure of
complex datasets. In this context, it is of high importance to develop
flexible models of signals defined over graphs or networks. In this
paper, we generalize the traditional concept of wide sense stationarity
to signals defined over the vertices of arbitrary weighted undirected
graphs. We show that stationarity is intimately linked to statistical
invariance under a localization operator reminiscent of translation. We
prove that stationary signals are characterized by a well-defined Power
Spectral Density that can be efficiently estimated even for large
graphs. We leverage this new concept to derive Wiener-type estimation
procedures of noisy and partially observed signals and illustrate the
performance of this new model for denoising and regression.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>We start with a de-convolution example on a random geometric graph.
This can model an array of sensors distributed in space or simply a
mesh. The signal is chosen with a low frequency band-limited PSD. To
produce the measurements, the signal is convolved with the heat kernel
<span class="math">\(e^{-\tau x}\)</span>. Additionally, we add some Gaussian noise. The heat
kernel is chosen because it simulates a diffusion process. Using
de-convolution we aim at recovering the original signal before
diffusion. For this experiment, we put ourselves in an ideal case and
suppose that  both the PSD  of the input signal and the noise level are
known.</p>
<p>Figure 1 and 2 present the results. We observe that Wiener filtering is
able to de-convolve the measurements. The second plot shows the
reconstruction errors for three different methods: Tikonov presented in
problem, TV and Wiener filtering. Wiener filtering performs clearly
much better than the other methods because it has a much better prior
assumption.</p>
