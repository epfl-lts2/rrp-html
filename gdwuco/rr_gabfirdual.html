<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>In this this experiment, we will present a dual Gabor window with short
support in a nonpainless setup, i.e. for a system with few frequency
channels. This has previously been attempted by Stromer (see the paper
for more information). However, the solutions obtained by the
truncation method proposed by him are often badly localized in
frequency due to the tendency of the truncation method to yield
nonsmooth solutions, i.e.  solutions with 'jumps' or discontinuity-like
behavior in time.</p>
<p>Here, we present the construction of a dual window that combines short
support with reasonable smoothness and therefore frequency
concentration. We start from a Gabor system <span class="math">\(G(g,30,60)\)</span> with
redundancy <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. The analysis window <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is chosen as a Nuttall window
of length <span class="math">\(L_g=120\)</span> samples.</p>

<p class="caption">Analysis window in frequency domain</p>
<div class="legend">
The 'Nuttall' window is very well localized in the frequency domain.</div>
</div>
<p>We desire a dual window <span class="math">\(h\)</span> with the same support as <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, i.e.
L_g = 120</p>
<!-- h  = argmin_x   alpha ||x||_1 + beta ||F x||_1 -->
<!-- +  mu || nabla x ||_2^2 + gamma || nabla F x ||_2^2 -->

<p>We minimize the norm of the gradient of x in order to have a smooth
windows. The L1 norms help the dual windows to be concentrated in time
and frequency.</p>
<p>The results in Figure below (c,d) show the optimal dual window with
regards to the regularization parameters: <span class="math">\(\alpha_1=\beta_{2}=0.001\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(\mu_{3}=\gamma_{4}=1\)</span>. Those values were chosen experimentally.</p>

</div>
<p>Minimizing the selected regularization functions improves upon the
desired features, in particular smoothness and localization by means of
minimizing the gradient. The addition of the sparsity terms is
supposed to suppress the tendency of the solution to have M-like
shape, i.e. multiple peaks. This is unwanted as it leads to windows
with ambiguous temporal or frequency position. Heuristically,
minimizing the <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span>-norm pushes all big coefficients to similar
values, therefore achieving the suppression of multiple significant
peaks.</p>
<p>The solution provided is assumed to perform perfect reconstruction on
any signal with admissible length greater or equal to <span class="math">\(L\)</span>. As in the
previous experiments, the maximum relative reconstruction error
(<span class="math">\(4.5e^{-14}\)</span>) is of the order of the machine precision.</p>
<p>To guarantee the canonical dual window to be supported on <span class="math">\(L_h=L_g\)</span>,
we would be required to increase the number of frequency channels to
<span class="math">\(M &gt;= 120\)</span>, putting us in the painless case. Therefore the redundancy is
increased twofold, which is an unwanted side effect. Alternatively, in
this setting, we could decide to keep the parameters <span class="math">\(a = 30\)</span>, <span class="math">\(M = 60\)</span>
fixed, but decrease the window size to <span class="math">\(L_g &lt; =60\)</span>. However, this
construction provides a system with a more than <span class="math">\(8\)</span> times larger frame
bound ratio. Consequently, the resulting canonical dual window <span class="math">\(h\)</span>,
shown in the figure bellow, shows bad frequency behavior and an
undesirable, M-like shape in time. In contrast, the method proposed in
the paper allows the use of nicely shaped,compactly supported dual
Gabor windows at low redundancies,  without the strong restrictions of
the painless case.</p>
