<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>We show the deference of different dual sythesis windows designed
either by classic techniques or by convex optimization.</p>
<p>All the examples provided in this experiment were computed with an
Itersine analysis window with <span class="math">\(L_g=60\)</span> <span class="math">\(L=240\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a=15\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M=120\)</span>,
without support constraints. This setup, in particular its high
redundancy, allows us to shape the dual windows rather freely for
different objective functions, therefore producing characteristic
examples. The window is shown below</p>

<p>To obtain different dual window than the canonical dual, we propose to
solve a convex optimization problem of the form:</p>
<!-- gd  = argmin_x    f(x) -->
<!-- such that    x is a dual windows of g and is compaclty supported -->
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}  \text{gd}  =  \text{arg} \min_x   &amp; f(x) \\\\     \text{such that }&amp; x \text{ is a dual windows of }g  \end{split}

</ul>

</dl>
<p>We compare several functions to be minimized. A list is presented here
below. To obtained the best window, we may use several of them:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><span class="math">\(|| x ||_2^2\)</span>         : minimize the two norm of the synthesis windows</li>
<li><span class="math">\(|| x ||_1\)</span>           : minimize the one norm of the synthesis windows</li>
<li><span class="math">\(|| F x ||_1\)</span>         : minimize the one norm in frequencie of the windows</li>
<li><span class="math">\(|| x - z ||_2^2\)</span>     : Make x look like z in the 2 norm sense</li>
<li><span class="math">\(var(x)\)</span>              : Localize x in time</li>
<li><span class="math">\(var(x^2)\)</span>            : Localize x in time</li>

<li><span class="math">\(var((F x)^2)\)</span>        : Localize x in frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>Solving the problem for each of these prior at once allows to produce
characteristic example to illustrate our technique</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lp-norm-priors">
<h2>Lp-norm priors</h2>
<p>In order to tune the solution of a convex optimization problem towards
the properties we desire, we have to select priors <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that
promote these properties. In this contribution, we mostly consider
priors that are fairly standard in optimization, or simple extensions
of such priors. Although their various effects are quite well known,
e.g. <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> optimization favors solutions with a few large values
while an <span class="math">\(l_2\)</span> prior favors a more even spread of the energy,
considerable limitations are imposed by the duality constraint.
Although the set of Gabor dual windows is characterized by the WR
equations, their implications in terms of window shape, localization,
decay etc. remain largely unexplored. Therefore a short discussion of
relevant priors, expected effects and their actual effect in our
context seems worthwhile.</p>
<p>An <span class="math">\(l_2\)</span> prior will, in our context, always lead to the canonical dual
Gabor window. In general, this prior will affect the values in a more
proportional way over the whole signal range. It is traditionally used
as a data fidelity term, i.e. the solution is expected to be close, in
the <span class="math">\(l_2\)</span>-norm sense, to a given estimate. The associated objective
function is not only convex, but also smooth, admitting gradient
descent approaches for minimization.</p>

<p class="caption">Synthesis dual window in frequency domain minimizing the l2 norm</p>
<div class="legend">
If we minimize the two norm of the sythesis window, we recover the
canonical dual.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="math">\(l_1\)</span>-norm minimization is usually considered, whenever (approximate)
sparsity, i.e. a small number of (significant) non-zero values is
desired. As the convex relaxation of the <span class="math">\(l_0\)</span> minimization problem, it
is equivalent or at least close to sparsity optimization under certain
conditions. In general, these conditions are not satisfied by the WR
eq. Nevertheless, the restrictions imposed by the WR equations usually
allow a solution with few large values. It should be noted however,
that small <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span>-norm does not imply clustering of the large values,
i.e. a solution supported on a short interval. As expected, some
concentration is induced by the duality constraint, see the figure
bellow. In the presented experiment, the <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> solution possesses only
<span class="math">\(15\)</span> values above <span class="math">\(-80\)</span>, only half the number of WR equations <span class="math">\(L a/M=30\)</span>.
However, other configurations have provided solutions with few
significant values spread over a larger interval.</p>
<p>The proximity operator of the <span class="math">\(\ell^1\)</span> prior is computed by soft-thresholding:</p>
<!-- soft_mu(y)  = sign(y) ( |y| - mu )_+ -->
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{soft}_\mu(y)=\text{sgn}(y) \left(|y|-\mu \right)_+
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\((.)_+=\max(.,0 )\)</span>. For compactly supported windows, a strictly
bandlimited dual window is usually not feasible. Therefore, when
applied in the Fourier domain, the <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> prior cannot achieve a truly
sparse solution, but promotes a small number of significant values. In
many cases, the result is similar to actual concentration measures.</p>

<h2>Concentration inducing function</h2>
<p>Our main objective in the following in this contribution will be the search for a
Gabor dual window with optimized/modified TF concentration. Therefore
we recall a number of different concentration measures. Inspired by the
famous Heisenberg inequality, the most natural way to impose
localization is to optimize the variance of the signal <span class="math">\(x\in \mathbb{R}^L\)</span> or
more precisely, its modulus:</p>
<!-- var(x) = 1/ sqrt(L)  sum_{i=-L/2}^{L/2-1} (i-\bar{|x|})^2 | x_i | -->
<!-- math: \text{var}(|x|)= 1/\sqrt{L} \sum_{i=-L/2}^{L/2-1}(i-\overline{|x|})^2|x_i| -->
<p>with <span class="math">\(\bar{|x|}=\sum_{i=-L/2}^{L/2-1}i | x_i |\)</span> being the center of
gravity. As we consider symmetric windows <span class="math">\(\bar{|x|}=0\)</span>, we can
simplify this expression to:
sum_{i=-L/2}^{L/2-1}(i)^2 | x_i |
to be a weighted <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span>-norm with quadratic weight <span class="math">\(w^2\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(w := 1 / \sqrt{L} [-L/2, ..., L/2-1]\)</span>. Compared to <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> minimization,
this prior additionally penalizes values far from the origin, inducing
concentration. The proximity operator of <span class="math">\(var(|x|)\)</span> is a variation of
the <span class="math">\(l_1\)</span> proximity operator and computed by weighted soft
thresholding. And example is shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="rr_gaboptdual_12.png" src="rr_gaboptdual_12.png" />

<img alt="rr_gaboptdual_13.png" src="rr_gaboptdual_13.png" />
<p class="caption">Synthesis dual window in frequency domain minimizing the variance it time</p>
</div>
<p>We also consider the variance of the energy of the signal:
<span class="math">\(var(|x|^2)\)</span>, for symmetric windows equal to a weighted <span class="math">\(l_2\)</span> norm with
linear weight <span class="math">\(w\)</span>: <span class="math">\(var(x^2)=||w  x||_2^2\)</span>. Explicit computation of the
proximity operator leads to</p>
<!-- prox_{gamma var(x^2) }(y) = 1 / ( 1 + 2 gamma w^2) * y -->
<!-- math: \text{prox}_{\gamma \text{var}(x^2) }(y) = \frac{1}{1+2\gamma w^2} y, -->
<p>i.e. multiplication with a function that decays quadratically away from
zero. The optimazation result is shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<img alt="rr_gaboptdual_14.png" src="rr_gaboptdual_14.png" />
<p class="caption">Synthesis dual window in time domain minimizing the energy variance it time</p>
<div class="legend">
There is also a good concentration in time, but with a kind of
smoothness.</div>

<p class="caption">Synthesis dual window in frequency domain minimizing the energy variance it time</p>
<div class="legend">
In frequency, we have a better decay compared to the optimization of
the variance only.</div>
</div>
<p>A closely related concentration measure is smoothness in frequency, as
measured by the gradient of the Fourier transform
x||_2^2
form:</p>
<!-- prox_{gamma ||\nabla F x||_2^2 }(y) = 1 / ( 1 + 2 gamma psi) * y -->
<!-- math \text{prox}_{\gamma \|\nabla \mathcal{F} x\|_2^2 }(y) = \frac{1}{1+2\gamma \psi} y -->
<p>with <span class="math">\(\psi[l] = 2-2 \cos(2 \pi l / L)\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(\psi[l] \approx C l^2\)</span>
for small <span class="math">\(l\)</span> and values away from <span class="math">\(0\)</span> are strongly attenuated, the
priors <span class="math">\(var(|x|^2)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(||\nabla F x||_2^2\)</span> often lead to similar
results. Both functions induce concentration by attenuation of values
far from the origin. Examples are shown in the figure below</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

operators are obtained simply by conjugating the proximitiy operators

<div class="section" id="simulataneous-time-frequency-concentration-function">
<h2>Simulataneous time/frequency concentration function</h2>
<p>For simultaneous concentration in time and frequency, we can consider
jointly the time- and frequency-domain variants of the priors discussed
above. Alternatively, we use a single cost functions providing
concentration in both domains at once. In TF literature, modulation
space norms, i.e. <span class="math">\(l_p\)</span>-norms on the short-time Fourier coefficients
are frequently used to measure joint TF localization.. In particular
<span class="math">\(||x||_{S_0}=|| G_{g,1,L} x||_1\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is a Gaussian function, is
considered as quality measure for window functions. Minimization of the
<span class="math">\(S_0\)</span>-norm can be expected to yield TF concentrated windows. However,
similar to the <span class="math">\(\ell^1\)</span>-norm, small <span class="math">\(S_0\)</span>-norm does not guarantee
concentration around the origin (or any single TF location). As
expected, the duality constraint seems to enforce some localization,
though.</p>
<p>Compared to the previously discussed priors, <span class="math">\(S_0\)</span> optimization is
considerably more expensive. Since we are not aware of a explicit
solution to the <span class="math">\(S_0\)</span> proximity operator, we propose its computation
via an iteration based on ADMM. The number
of required ADMM steps per PPXA iteration is low and scales well with
<span class="math">\(L\)</span> (usually 3-4 steps provided sufficient precision), but each substep
requires the computation of one full STFT and one inverse STFT, with a
complexity of <span class="math">\(O(L^2 \log(L))\)</span> each. An example for <span class="math">\(S_0\)</span>
optimization is shown in the figure below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<div class="legend">
A well concentrated windows in frenquency</div>
</div>
<p>In some cases, concentration can be further increased by <span class="math">\(S_0\)</span>-norm
instead. The proximity operator is realized similar to the unweighted
case. The next figures show an example, considering the following
circular weights:</p>
<!-- W[f,t]= ln( 1 + w^2[t] + w^2[f] ) -->
<!-- math: W[f,t]=\ln \left( 1 + w^2[t]+w^2[f] \right), -->
<p>using the weight <span class="math">\(w\)</span> as defined above.</p>
<p>While other weights are clearly feasible, the weight above has been
tuned to yield good results in our experiments.</p>

<h2>Other cost functions</h2>
<p>The list of possible cost functions is vast and the full exploration of
the possibilities of convex optimization in window design is far beyond
the scope of any single contribution. As a rather academic example, we
propose a free design approach that selects the dual Gabor window
closest to the linear span of a model window <span class="math">\(g_{sh}\)</span>, i.e. we find</p>
<!-- argmin || x - P_<g_sh>(x)||_2    such that x is dual -->
<!-- math:  \mathop{\operatorname{arg~min}}\limits _{x \in \mathcal{C}_{\text{dual}}}\|x - P_{\langle g_{s}\rangle}x\|_2^2, -->
<p>where <span class="math">\(&lt; g_s&gt;\)</span> is the linear span of <span class="math">\(g_s\)</span>. The solution is computed by
a POCS (projection onto convex set) algorithm. Due to the examples
academic nature, we were not concerned with convergence time. Examples
using a sine wave and a dirac pulse as model window are presented in
