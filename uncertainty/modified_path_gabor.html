<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Uncertainty principles such as Heisenberg's provide limits on the
time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform
dictionary design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for
reconstructing missing information from graph signals via sparse
representations, and yield new graph analysis tools. While previous
work has focused on generalizing notions of spreads of a graph signal
in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our approach is to generalize
the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty principles that
provide limits on the concentration of the analysis coefficients of any
graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are jointly
localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data
domain, the local structure in a single small region of the graph can
drastically affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in
different regions of the graph, limiting the information provided by
global uncertainty principles. Accordingly, we suggest a new way to
incorporate a notion of locality, and develop local uncertainty
principles that bound the concentration of the analysis coefficients of
each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame in terms of
quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around the
center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our
proposed local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of
graph signals.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>On a <span class="math">\(64\)</span> node modified path graph for details), we compute the graph
Gabor transform of the signals <span class="math">\(f_1=T_1g_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f_2=T_{64}g_0\)</span>. In
Figure ref{fig:path_node_away_ambiguity}, we show the evolution of the
graph Gabor transforms of the two signals with respect to the distance
<span class="math">\(d=1/W_{12}\)</span> from the first to the second vertex in the graph. As the
first node is pulled away, a localized eigenvector appears centered on
the isolated vertex. Because of this, as this distance increases, the
signal <span class="math">\(f_1\)</span> becomes concentrated in both the vertex and graph spectral
domains, leading to graph Gabor transform coefficients that are highly
concentrated. However, since the graph modification is local, it does
not drastically affect the graph Gabor transform coefficients of the
signal <span class="math">\(f_2\)</span>, whose energy is concentrated on the far end of the path
graph.</p>
<p>In Figure 1, we plot the evolution of the uncertainty bounds as well as
the concentration of the Gabor transform coefficients of <span class="math">\(f_1\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(f_2\)</span>. The global uncertainty bound from our Theorem tells us that
<span class="math">\(s_1(A_g f)\leq\max_{i,k}||T_i g_k||_2,\hbox{ for any signal }f.\)</span>
The local uncertainty bound from our Theorem tells us that
<span class="math">\(s_1(A_\gg T_{i_0}g_{k_0})\leq||T_{\tilde{i}_{i_0,k_0}}g_{\tilde{k}_{i_0,k_0}}||_2,\hbox{ for all }i_0\hbox{ and }k_0.\)</span>
Thus, we can view the global uncertainty bound as an upper bound on all
of the local uncertainty bounds. In fact the bumps in the global
uncertainty bound in Figure~ref{fig:bound Agf} correspond to the local
bound with <span class="math">\(i_0=1\)</span> and   different frequency bands <span class="math">\(k_0\)</span>.
We plot the local bounds for <span class="math">\(i_0=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_0=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k_0=2\)</span>.</p>

Concentration of the graph Gabor coefficients of <span class="math">\(f_1=T_1g_0\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(f_2=T_{64}g_0\)</span> with respect to the distance between the first two
vertices in the modified path graph, along with the upper bounds on
this concentration from  Theorem  ref{Co:Lieblocgraph} (global
uncertainty) and Theorem ref{theo:local_uncertainty} (local
uncertainty). Each bump of the global bound corresponds to a local
bound of a given spectral band of node <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. For clarity, we plot
only bands <span class="math">\(\widehat{g_0}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\widehat{g_2}\)</span> for node <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. For
node <span class="math">\(64\)</span>, the local bound is barely affected by the change in graph
structure, and the sparsity levels of the graph Gabor transform
coefficients of <span class="math">\(T_{64}g_0\)</span> also do not change much.</div>
