<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Uncertainty principles such as Heisenberg's provide limits on the
time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform
dictionary design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for
reconstructing missing information from graph signals via sparse
representations, and yield new graph analysis tools. While previous
work has focused on generalizing notions of spreads of a graph signal
in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our approach is to generalize
the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty principles that
provide limits on the concentration of the analysis coefficients of any
graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are jointly
localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data
domain, the local structure in a single small region of the graph can
drastically affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in
different regions of the graph, limiting the information provided by
global uncertainty principles. Accordingly, we suggest a new way to
incorporate a notion of locality, and develop local uncertainty
principles that bound the concentration of the analysis coefficients of
each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame in terms of
quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around the
center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our
proposed local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of
graph signals.</p>

<h2>Experiment 1</h2>
<p>We start with a standard path graph of <span class="math">\(10\)</span> nodes equally spaced (all
edge weights are equal to one) and we move the first node out to the
left; i.e., we reduce the weight between the first two nodes (see
Figure 1). The weight is related to the distance by <span class="math">\(W_{12}=1/d(1,2)\)</span>
with <span class="math">\(d(1,2)\)</span> being the distance between nodes 1 and 2. When the weight
between nodes 1 and 2 decreases, the eigenvector associated with the
largest eigenvalue of the Laplacian becomes more concentrated, which
increases the coherence <span class="math">\(\mu_{G}\)</span> (Figure 2).</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows the computation of the quantities involved in (1), with
<span class="math">\(p=1\)</span> and different graph's taken to be the modified path graphs of the
modified path, with different distances between the first two vertices.
We show the lefthand side of (1) for two different Kronecker deltas,
one centered at vertex 1, and one centered at vertex 10. We have seen
in <span class="linkrole"><a href="#BASEURL#/uncertainty/global_illustration.html">global_illustration</a></span> that as the distance between the first two
vertices increases, the coherence increases, and therefore the lower
bound on the right-hand side of (1) decreases. For <span class="math">\(\delta_1\)</span>, the
uncertainty quantity on the left-hand side of (1) follows a similar
pattern. The intuition behind this is that as the weight between the
first two vertices decreases, a few of the eigenvectors start to have
local jumps around the first vertex (see <span class="linkrole"><a href="#BASEURL#/uncertainty/modified_path_eigenvectors.html">modified_path_eigenvectors</a></span>
). As a result, we can sparsely represent <span class="math">\(\delta_1\)</span> as a linear
combination of those eigenvectors and <span class="math">\(||\widehat{\delta_1}||_1\)</span> is
reduced. However,  since there are not any eigenvectors that are
localized around the last vertex in the path graph, we cannot find a
sparse linear combination of the graph Laplacian eigenvectors to
represent <span class="math">\(\delta_{10}\)</span>. Therefore, its uncertainty quantity on the
left-hand side of (1) does not follow the behavior of the lower bound.</p>

<p>The Hausdorff-Young Theorem for graph signals is stated as:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\mu_{G}\)</span> be the coherence between the graph Fourier and canonical
bases of a graph <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(p,q&gt;0\)</span> be such that
<span class="math">\(\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1\)</span>. For any signal <span class="math">\(f \in \mathbb{C}^N\)</span>
defined on <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1 \leq p \leq 2\)</span>, we have</p>
<!-- .|| \hat f ||_q \leq \mu_{G}^{1-\frac{2}{q}} || f ||_p, (2) -->
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\| \hat f \|_q \leq \mu_{G}^{1-\frac{2}{q}} \| f \|_p, \hspace{1cm} (2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and conversly:</p>
<!-- .|| \hat f \|_q \geq \mu_{G}^{1-\frac{2}{q}} || f ||_p. (3) -->
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\| \hat f \|_q \geq \mu_{G}^{1-\frac{2}{q}} \| f \|_p. \hspace{1cm} (3)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Continuing with the modified path graphs, we illustrate the bounds of
the Hausdorff-Young Hausdorff-Young Theorem. this example, we take the
signal <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to be <span class="math">\(\delta_1\)</span>, a Kronecker delta centered on the first
node of the modified path graph. As a consequence, <span class="math">\(\|\delta_1\|_p=1\)</span>
for all <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, which makes it easier to compare the quantities involved
in the inequalities. For this example, the bounds of Hausdorff-Young
Theorem are fairly close to the actual values of
<span class="math">\(\|\hat{\delta_1}\|_q\)</span>.</p>
