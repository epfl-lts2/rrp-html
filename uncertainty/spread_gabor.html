<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Uncertainty principles such as Heisenberg's provide limits on the
time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform
dictionary design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for
reconstructing missing information from graph signals via sparse
representations, and yield new graph analysis tools. While previous
work has focused on generalizing notions of spreads of a graph signal
in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our approach is to generalize
the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty principles that
provide limits on the concentration of the analysis coefficients of any
graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are jointly
localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data
domain, the local structure in a single small region of the graph can
drastically affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in
different regions of the graph, limiting the information provided by
global uncertainty principles. Accordingly, we suggest a new way to
incorporate a notion of locality, and develop local uncertainty
principles that bound the concentration of the analysis coefficients of
each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame in terms of
quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around the
center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our
proposed local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of
graph signals.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>In Figure 1, we analyze a series of signals on a random sensor network
of 100 vertices. Each signal is created by localizing a heat kernel to
be centered at vertex 1 (circled in black). To generate the four
different signals, we vary the value of the parameter <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span> in the
heat kernel. We plot the four localized kernels in the graph spectral
and vertex domains in the first two columns, respectively. The more we
&quot;compress&quot; <span class="math">\(\hat{h}\)</span> in the graph spectral domain (i.e. we reduce its
spectral spreading by increasing <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>), the less concentrated the
localized atom becomes in the vertex domain. The joint vertex-frequency
representation <span class="math">\(|A_g T_1h_\tau(i,k)|\)</span> of each signal is shown in the
third column, which illustrates the trade-off between concentration in
the vertex and the spectral domains. The concentration of these graph
Gabor transform coefficients is the quantity bounded by the uncertainty
principle presented in our uncertainty principle Theorem. In the last
row of the Figure 1, <span class="math">\(\tau=\infty\)</span> which leads to a Kronecker delta for
the kernel and a constant on the vertex domain. On the contrary, when
the kernel is constant, with <span class="math">\(\tau=0\)</span> (top row), the energy of the
graph Gabor coefficients stays concentrated around one vertex but
spreads along all frequencies.</p>

<div class="legend">
First column: the kernel <span class="math">\(h_{\tau}(\lambda)\)</span> is shown in red and the
localized kernel <span class="math">\(\widehat{f_{\tau}}\)</span> is shown in blue, both in the
graph spectral domain. Second column: the signal <span class="math">\(f_{\tau}\)</span> in the
vertex domain (the center vertex 1 is circled). Third column:
<span class="math">\(|A_g T_1h_\tau (i,k)|\)</span>, the absolute value of the Gabor
transform coefficients for each vertex <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and each of the 20
frequency bands <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. Fourth column: since it is hard to see where on
the graph the transform coefficients are concentrated when the nodes
are placed on a line in the third column, we display the value
<span class="math">\(\sum_{k=0}^{19}  |A_g T_1h_\tau (i,k)|\)</span> on each vertex <span class="math">\(i\)</span> in
the network. This figure illustrates the tradeoff between the vertex
and the frequency concentration.</div>
