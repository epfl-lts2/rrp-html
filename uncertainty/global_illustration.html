<h2>Abstract of the paper</h2>
<p>Uncertainty principles such as Heisenberg's provide limits on the
time-frequency concentration of a signal, and constitute an important
theoretical tool for designing and evaluating linear signal transforms.
Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform
dictionary design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for
reconstructing missing information from graph signals via sparse
representations, and yield new graph analysis tools. While previous
work has focused on generalizing notions of spreads of a graph signal
in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our approach is to generalize
the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty principles that
provide limits on the concentration of the analysis coefficients of any
graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are jointly
localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we
highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data
domain, the local structure in a single small region of the graph can
drastically affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in
different regions of the graph, limiting the information provided by
global uncertainty principles. Accordingly, we suggest a new way to
incorporate a notion of locality, and develop local uncertainty
principles that bound the concentration of the analysis coefficients of
each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame in terms of
quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around the
center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our
proposed local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of
graph signals.</p>

<h2>This experiment</h2>
<p>Let us consider the two manifolds (surfaces) embedded in <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^3\)</span> and
shown in Figures 1 and 2. The first one is a flat square. The second is
identical except for the center where it contains a spike. We sample
both of these manifolds uniformly across the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math">\(y\)</span> plane and create a
graph by connecting the <span class="math">\(8\)</span> nearest neighbors with weights depending on
the distance (<span class="math">\(W_{ij}=e^{-d_{ij}/\sigma}\)</span>). The energy of each
Laplacian eigenvector of the graph arising from the first manifold is
not concentrated on any particular vertex; i.e.,
<span class="math">\(\max_{i,\ell}|u_\ell(i)| &lt;&lt; 1\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(u_\ell\)</span> is the eigenvector
associated with eigenvalue <span class="math">\(\lambda_\ell\)</span>. However, the graph arising
from the second manifold does have a few eigenvectors, such as
eigenvector 3 shown in Figure 3, whose energy is highly concentrated on
the region of the spike; i.e: <span class="math">\(\max_{i,\ell}|u_\ell(i)| \approx 1\)</span>.
Yet, the Laplacian eigenvectors of this second graph whose energy
resides primarily on the flatter regions of the manifold, such as
eigenvector 17 shown in Figure 5, are not too concentrated on any
single vertex. Rather, they more closely resemble some of the Laplacian
eigenvectors of the graph arising from the first manifold.</p>
<p>We discretize two different manifolds by sampling uniformly across the
<span class="math">\(x\)</span>-<span class="math">\(y\)</span> plane. Due its bumpy central part, the graph arising from
manifold 2 has a graph Laplacian eigenvector (shown in the middle row
of the right column) that is highly concentrated in both the vertex and
graph spectral domains. However, the eigenvectors of this graph whose
energy primarily resides in the flatter parts of the manifold (such as
the one shown in the bottom row of the right column) are less
concentrated, and some closely resemble the Laplacian eigenvectors of
the graph arising from the flat manifold 1 (such as the corresponding
eigenvector shown in the bottom row of the left column.</p>
